# ThreeJs
Below is the three.js prototype project, which has a 3D truck model and a wire framed cuboid. The goal of the project is to make 3D model of a 
truck and its trailer, where we can drag and drop objects into the truck to achieve FULL TRUCK LOAD.
Currently this project is development face and I am working on syncing the truck model to the cuboid.
